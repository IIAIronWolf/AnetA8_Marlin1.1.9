# AnetA8_Marlin1.1.9
This is my configuration for my Anet A8 on Marlin 1.1.9

Memory usage at current config is 99% - 129570 of 130048 using the Anet V1.0 (Optiboot) bootloader.

I tried to keep track of memory usage for each additional feature I enabled, after first compiling the default Anet A8 config, which was already at 82% memory. I have added comments to the additional features I added with an approx. amount of additional memory used.
